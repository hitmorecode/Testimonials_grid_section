            I received a job offer mid -course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more os, in the company I joined. 
            I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”
